Welcome to this amazing experience that is trying out your very first game with the Murder Engine.

### How to build it?
The first step is to create your game with an editor. Open in Visual Studio (2022+ so it supports .NET 7), make sure that `HelloMurder.Editor` is your startup project and click **F5**.

### How do I play the game?
You can either press **F5** in the editor or switch the startup project to `HelloMurder`. And that's it!
